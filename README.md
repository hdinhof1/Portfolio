The Datacubed app is currently in both the iOS and Android app stores. It allows participants in drug trials to fill out information forms about how their study is going. Instead of driving to a physical testing site, this app enables participants to enter info on their own smartphone, at their own convenience. Data entry is comprised of surveys, articles, tasks (cognitive games), medication adherence (injection location) and eDiaries. There's also eConsent, which allows users to "sign" and also consent to a study. Supports patient engagement through push notifications. Enables BYOD "Bring your own device" studies. Due to contractual limitations I can’t show more screenshots than what is publicly available. The app is available in the [iOS app store here (link).](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linkt-health/id1311680324) and more information is [on the website here (link).](https://www.datacubed.com)

Makes an event out of grabbing a drink with friends. For participating bars, the first round is on the house! Bars use FROTH to test out new drink ideas, and get more foot traffic into the place. FROTH collects info about what drink you wanted to test as well as makes it easier for groups to organize for drinks. FROTH was acquired by Good Passports in July 2017.
